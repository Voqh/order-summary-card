## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Elenemt Shadow; To give an element shadow, use the box-shadow property with a vertical and a horizontal values. Add a blur value to give the shadow a blur effect.

```css
.button1 {
  background-color: var(--Bright-blue);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 20px 10px var(--Pale-blue);
}
```

### Continued development

Explore text-shadow and box-shadow property values.
