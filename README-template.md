## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Elenemt Shadow; To give an element shadow, use the box-shadow property with a vertical and a horizontal values. Add a blur value to give the shadow a blur effect.

```css
.button1{
    background-color: var(--Bright-blue);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow:5px 20px 10px var(--Pale-blue);
}
```

### Continued development
Explore text-shadow and box-shadow property values.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) - This helped me for CSS Opacity / Transparency.Image and code Exmples were really helpful.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS box-shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
